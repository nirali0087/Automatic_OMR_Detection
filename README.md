# Automatic OMR Detection
Automatic OMR Detection is a Python-based application that automates the evaluation of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheets, commonly used in multiple-choice examinations. By leveraging image processing techniques, this system accurately detects and grades marked answers, streamlining the assessment process.

# 📌 Features

Image Preprocessing: Enhances scanned OMR sheets through grayscale conversion, thresholding, and noise reduction.

Contour Detection: Identifies and isolates the answer sheet area for focused analysis.

Bubble Detection: Locates and interprets filled bubbles to determine selected answers.

Automated Grading: Compares detected answers against a predefined answer key to compute scores.

Result Visualization: Displays the evaluated sheet with correct and incorrect answers highlighted.​

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for application logic.

OpenCV: Image processing library for handling and analyzing OMR sheets.

NumPy: Supports numerical operations and array manipulations.
